# Operation Aurora — Threat Intelligence Report

## 1. Executive Summary

Operation Aurora was a coordinated cyber espionage campaign targeting multiple major U.S. technology, defense, and manufacturing corporations, publicly disclosed by Google in January 2010 following its own internal investigation. The disclosure marked one of the first instances where a multinational technology company openly confronted a nation-state-linked operation, significantly reshaping the dialogue around responsible disclosure and corporate cyber defense transparency.

The attackers exploited a previously unknown Internet Explorer zero-day to achieve remote code execution, establish footholds, and pivot to sensitive areas of victim networks. Once inside, they sought access to intellectual property, source code repositories, internal engineering documentation, and confidential business data. Google’s forensic analysis and subsequent public statement became pivotal in exposing the scope of the compromise and encouraging other affected companies to reassess their exposure.

Multiple cybersecurity intelligence organizations assess with high confidence that the attackers originated from China-aligned threat actors with strategic motivations focused on long-term technological and geopolitical gain. Operation Aurora is historically significant because it marked a turning point in public-private collaboration against advanced threats, influenced future supply-chain compromises, and began establishing the modern standards for threat attribution and transparency that today’s cybersecurity community seeks to emulate.
